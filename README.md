# About :
Passionate about the design of websites for years, I have evolved over time at different positions. After several certifications, I now position myself as a front-end developer even if I still evolve on back-end sometimes. I like working with Bootstrap, Flexbox, HTML/CSS/SCSS, Symfony, Twig, Figma, Webpack, PHP, Javascript, Git (non-exhaustive list)...
